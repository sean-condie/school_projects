ANS: For loops are great for iterating over a defined period. While loops are great for performing a task until a condition is met.
While loops are good at morphing to accomadate diferent data. For loops tend to be more restricted to set lengths. 
A loop is appropriate to use when there is a specific task that needs to be repeated several times.

m <- matrix(nrow=100, ncol=50)

for(i in 1:dim(m)[2]) {   #iterate over the columns
 num <- rpois(100, i)     #generate a new poisson distribution for each column with mean i, column i
 for(j in 1:dim(m)[1]) {  #iterate over each row in the column
  m[j,i] = num[j]         #set the row value to one of the values in the distribution
 }
}

i)
attach(mtcars) #load the dataset
plot(carb, mpg, col=2) #create the plot
points(drat, mpg, col=3) #add another variable's points with a different colour
points(wt, mpg, col=4) #add another variable's points with a different colour
points(cyl, mpg, col=5) #add another variable's points with a different colour

ii)
attach(mtcars) #load the dataset
plot(carb, mpg, pch=2, main = "Multi-Variable Plot", xlab = "") #create the plot with no x label and a title
points(drat, mpg, pch=3) #add another variable's points with a different symbol
points(wt, mpg, pch=4) #add another variable's points with a different symbol
points(cyl, mpg, pch=5) #add another variable's points with a different symbol
legend("topright", legend = c("carb", "drat", "wt", "cyl"), pch = c(2,3,4,5)) #add a ledgend to the top right of the chart

attach(iris) #load the dataset
boxplot(Sepal.Width~Species, medcol = "blue") #create a boxplot of sepal width between species with a blue median

ANS: A box plot allows us to visualize quartile information of out data as well as the median and potential outliers.

ANS: Insectivores seem to have more REM sleep while herbivores seem to have the least REM sleep, as a percentage of total sleep. 
Carnivores have a large range of total sleep values which seem to be highly correlated to REM sleep. Herbivores REM sleep seems to be less correlated with total sleep.
